## Analysis

Jupyter notebook to analyze trial .txt files.

## Running

These Jupyter notebooks should be run on an analysis machine, they should not be run on the Raspberry Pi. This assumes the Raspberry Pi is running a file server and the trial files can be accessed remotely.

```
cd /Volumes/pi15/pie/analysis
jupyter notebook
```
