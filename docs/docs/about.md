The PiE server was designed, coded, and is maintained by [Robert Cudmore](http://robertcudmore.org).

## History

This project is evolving from 2016 to present. It began as more than three different projects, one for [video recording][trigger-camera2], one for the [home-cage/behavior box][homecage], and another for the [treadmill][treadmill]. The functionality of all these projects have been merged into the current PiE server.
 
## Open Source

The PiE server only exists because of the massive amount of hard-work, creativity, and expertise that has been put in to creating and maintaining a multiplicity of open-source software projects.
